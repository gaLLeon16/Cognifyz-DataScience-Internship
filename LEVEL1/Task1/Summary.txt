Level 1 â€“ Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Objective:

To explore and understand the dataset by analyzing its structure, cleaning missing data, and examining the distribution of the Aggregate rating column.

Steps Performed:

1.Loaded the dataset using Python's pandas library.
2.Inspected dataset structure:
 Rows: 9551
 Columns: 21
3.Checked data types of each column using .dtypes.
4.Identified missing values using .isnull().sum():
Found 9 missing values in the "Cuisines" column.
5.Cleaned the data by dropping rows with missing values using .dropna().
Cleaned dataset shape: 9542 rows, 21 columns.
6.Analyzed the distribution of "Aggregate rating" using .value_counts()

Key Observations:

The dataset mostly consists of valid, complete entries.
Only 9 rows had missing cuisines, which were safely dropped.
The most common rating is 0.0 (2148 restaurants), which may indicate unrated or newly added listings.
Ratings between 3.0 to 4.5 were the most frequent, showing a concentration of average-to-good rated restaurants.
Very few restaurants had ratings below 2.0, and only 1 restaurant had 1.8.
