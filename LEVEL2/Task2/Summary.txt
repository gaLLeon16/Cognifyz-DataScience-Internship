Level 2 – Task 2: Price Range Analysis
 Objective:
To analyze how restaurant price range relates to ratings and rating color, and identify patterns that indicate quality or affordability.

Steps Performed:
1. Identified the most common price range among all restaurants.
2. Calculated the average aggregate rating for each price range (1 to 4).
3. Found the rating color most frequently used for the price range with the highest average rating.

Key Observations:
1. Most Common Price Range: 1 (budget-friendly)
2. Highest Average Rating: Found in Price Range 4 (premium restaurants)
      Average Rating: 3.82
3. Most Common Rating Color for Price Range 4: Yellow

Conclusion:
Although most restaurants fall under Price Range 1, they receive the lowest average ratings. On the other hand, restaurants in Price Range 4 (likely premium restaurants) receive the highest ratings, and most of them are marked with the Yellow rating color, indicating “Good” to “Very Good” experience.
