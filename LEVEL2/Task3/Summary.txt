Level 2 â€“ Task 3: Feature Engineering

Objective:
To enhance the dataset by creating new features from existing columns that can make analysis and machine learning models more meaningful and effective.

New Features Created:
1. Rating Category
     Based on Aggregate rating, categorized into:
     Unrated, Poor, Average, Good, Excellent
     Helps classify restaurants into quality levels
2. Primary Cuisine
     Extracted the first cuisine from multi-cuisine entries in the Cuisines column
     Makes it easier to group restaurants by their main cuisine type
3. Price Label
     Converted Price range into simplified groups: Budget (1 or 2), Premium (3 or 4)
     Useful for analyzing service patterns based on affordability

Conclusion:
By applying feature engineering, we transformed raw columns into more informative categories. These new features make the dataset better for storytelling, grouping, and predictive modeling
