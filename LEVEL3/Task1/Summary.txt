Level 3 Task 1: Predictive Modeling

Objective:
To build a machine learning model that can predict the rating category of a restaurant based on features like price range, votes, and delivery options.

Approach:
Cleaned the dataset and removed missing values
Engineered helpful features like:
  Rating Category from Aggregate rating
  Price Label (Budget or Premium)
  Converted Yes/No to 1/0 for online delivery and table booking
Used a Decision Tree Classifier for classification

Target Variable:
Rating Category
(Unrated, Poor, Average, Good, Excellent)

Model Performance:
Achieved 75.33% accuracy on the test data

Conclusion:
The model was able to predict restaurant rating categories with a solid 75%+ accuracy using just 4 simple features. This shows the power of basic machine learning and feature engineering in extracting value from raw data.
