Level 3 – Task 3: Data Visualization
Objective:
To build visualizations that clearly present patterns, distributions, and relationships in the restaurant dataset, helping turn raw data into visual insight.

Visualizations Created:
1. Rating Category Distribution
A bar plot showing how restaurants are rated across five categories: Unrated, Poor, Average, Good, Excellent.

2. Top 10 Primary Cuisines
A horizontal bar chart displaying the most frequently listed first cuisines — helps identify what's most commonly offered.

3. Votes by Price Range (Boxplot)
Visualized how customer engagement (votes) varies across different price ranges.

4. Rating vs Online Delivery (Boxplot)
Compared restaurant ratings based on whether they offer online delivery or not.

5. Rating vs Table Booking (Boxplot)
Compared ratings for restaurants with and without table booking facilities.

Conclusion:
Visualization played a key role in validating earlier insights from feature engineering and predictive modeling. The visuals make trends more accessible and support informed decision-making for businesses and analysts.
